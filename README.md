# Mall-Customer-Segmentation
In this data analysis project we will perform customer segmentation on a specific group of mall customers. We will identify the best possible cluster using the KMeans unsupervised machine learning algorithm to find the univariate, bivariate, and multivariate clusters. Once these clusters are identified, summary statistics can be performed on these to identify the best marketing group.

# Problem Statement
Understand the Target Customers for the marketing team to plan a strategy

# Context
Your boss wants you to identify the most important shopping groups based on income, age, andthe mall shopping score.

# Objective Market Segmentation
Divide your mall target market into approachable groups. Create subsets of a market based on demographics behavioral criteria to better understand the target for marketing activites.

# The Approach
1. Perform some quick EDA
2. Use KMEANS Clustering Algorithm to create our segments
3. Use Summary Statistics on the clusters
4. Visualize

# Requirements
1. Standard Python Installation
2. Jupyter Notebook

# Analysis
 ### Tareget Cluster
 1. Target group would be cluster 1 which has a high Spending Score and high income

    
 2. 60% of cluster 1 shoppers are woman. We should look for ways to attract these customers using a marketing campaign targeting popular items in this cluster

   
 3. Cluster 2 presents an intersting opportunity to market to the customers for sales event on popular items.
