# Mall-Customer-Segmentation
In this data analysis project we will perform customer segmentation on a specific group of mall customers. We will identify the best possible cluster using the KMeans unsupervised machine learning algorithm to find the univariate, bivariate, and multivariate clusters. Once these clusters are identified, summary statistics can be performed on these to identify the best marketing group.
